Statistical analysis of gut microbiota samples from EAE mice

This code contains the statistical analysis performed to generate the graphs and tables represented in the manuscript. It also includes the statistical tests conducted to identify significant changes in the microbiota.

To facilitate reading and understanding of the script, this file includes the code used for the samples of orally administered melatonin in female mice. For the rest of the samples (males, peritoneal administration, and progression), the code is the same, except for the files used and, in the case of the progression analysis, the name of the groups.
